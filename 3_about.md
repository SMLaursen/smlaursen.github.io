title: About me
---
I'm currently enrolled as a PhD student in the [Embedded Systems Engineering](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/ESE) section at The Technical University of Denmark. Before starting my PhD I was employed as a Software Engineer at [Terma A/S](http://www.terma.com/) working within the naval defense domain.

This blog is mainly devoted to my research on *Analysis and optimization of safety-critical embedded systems*.

Feel free to [write me](mailto:Sune1987@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
